##4.4 Question 1  
## the second my_variable is spelt incorrectly should be:
my_variable <- 10
my_variable 

## Question 2 - Fixed typos and incorrect code, now runs correctly
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)

## Question 3
## Alt + Shift + K Brings up keyboard short cuts, same can be achieved by going into the tools part of the menu


## 5.2.4 Question 1
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

##1. Find all flights that
## 1.1. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours.
filter(flights, arr_delay>=120)

##1.2. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)
filter(flights, dest == 'IAH' | dest == 'HOU')

## 1.3. Were operated by United, American, or Delta
filter(flights, carrier == 'UA' | carrier == 'AA' | carrier == 'DL')

## 1.4. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
filter(flights, month >= 7 & month <= 9)

## 1.5. Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
filter(flights, arr_delay > 120, dep_delay <= 0)

## 1.6. Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60, dep_delay-arr_delay > 30)

##1.7. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
filter(flights, dep_time <=600 | dep_time == 2400)

## Question 2
filter(flights, between(month, 7, 9))

## Question 3 Code Below: 8255 NA dep_time 
summary(flights)

## Question 4
## NA ^ 0 = 1 anything to the 0 power = 1
## NA | TRUE gives will return true as you are giving the option to return true or NA 
## NA & FALSE will return false as you can't have both values at once

## 5.3.1 Question 1
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df, desc(is.na(x)))

## Question 2
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
arrange(flights, dep_delay)

## Question 3
arrange(flights, (arr_time - dep_time))

## Question 4
arrange(flights, desc(distance))
arrange(flights, distance)

## 5.4.1 Question 2
## The variable only occurs once rather than multiple times 

## Question 3 
## Returns all the variables asked for as well as will identify if there's an unknown variable

## Question 4 Result returns all the columns that contain time, case doesnt matter in select typically 
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
